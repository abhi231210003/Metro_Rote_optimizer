# Metro_Rote_optimizer
This project implements a metro route planner that models the metro system as a graph. It provides functionalities to calculate the shortest distance, minimum travel time, and identify interchanges between metro lines using depth-first search (DFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm. The program also includes features to display the metro map and compute travel costs based on distance.
Java is used as programming language in this project.
