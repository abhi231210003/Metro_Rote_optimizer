# Metro_Rote_optimizer
This project, implemented in Java, is a metro route optimizer that models the metro system as a graph. It provides functionalities to calculate the shortest distance, minimum travel time, and identify interchanges between metro lines using depth-first search (DFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm. The program also includes features to display the metro map and compute travel costs based on distance.
